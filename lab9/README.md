## Simple Linear Regression

## Goal

My goal for this project was to reproduce my report from [hw02](https://github.com/laurenhanlon/stat159-datascience/tree/master/stat159-hw02) using Rnw format, and to convert it into a LaTeX document. HW 2 conducted a simple analysis using the [Advertising.csv](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv) dataset to look at sales across various products as a function of advertising budget, specifically for TV media spend.

I converted the Rmd file into Rnw, abiding by LaTeX styling rules to produce a similar output. Since LaTeX is the default syntax in many professional publications, it's important that I am able to use Rnw to write LaTeX documents.


### Resources Used
I used the data and followed the regresion analysis from _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
