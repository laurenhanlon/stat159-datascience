## Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science

This repo contains all contents relating to UC Berkeley's Stat 159: Reproducibe and Collaborate Data Science taught by Professor Gaston Sanchez

> A project-based introduction to statistical data analysis. Through case studies, computer laboratories, and a term project, students learn practical techniques and tools for producing statistically sound and appropriate, reproducible, and verifiable computational answers to scientific questions. Course emphasizes version control, testing, process automation, code review, and collaborative programming. Software tools may include Bash, Git, pandoc, Makefile, Markdown, LaTeX, R, Python.
