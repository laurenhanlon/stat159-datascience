## Goal

My goal for this lab was baesd on the simple regression from [hw02](https://github.com/laurenhanlon/stat159-datascience/tree/master/stat159-hw02). I plotted scatter plots of sales vs different advertising channels. The plot displayed is configured by the selection of items in a dropdown.

My ShinyDoc has a dropdown with a list of 3 options - TV, Radio and newspaper as input elements. The output is a scatter plot between sales and the input chosen from the dropdown.


### Resources Used
I used the data and followed the regresion analysis from _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
